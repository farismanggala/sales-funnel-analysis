🔍 Revenue Impact & Funnel Optimization Insight

The largest drop-off occurs at the Cart → Purchase stage, indicating high purchase intent but significant checkout friction.

Despite a healthy volume of users reaching the cart, a substantial portion fails to complete the transaction, suggesting issues such as pricing transparency, shipping cost shock, payment failure, or checkout UX complexity.

Revenue analysis shows that increasing late-stage conversion yields higher and faster impact compared to acquiring new traffic or improving early funnel stages.

Simulation results indicate that a 1–5% improvement in Cart → Purchase conversion could generate a meaningful increase in completed purchases without additional marketing spend.

This highlights checkout optimization as a high-ROI growth lever, where small UX or payment improvements can directly translate into revenue gains.

📌 Business Recommendation

Prioritize checkout flow optimization, including payment success rate, cost transparency, and UX simplification.

Run A/B testing on checkout pages to identify friction points.

Monitor Cart → Purchase conversion as a core KPI for short-term revenue growth.
