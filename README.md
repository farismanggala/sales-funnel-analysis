Business Question :
Why conversion drops across the sales funnel and which stage contributes the most to revenue loss?

What i found regarding conversion :
1. Major drop happens between Cart to Purchase with conversion rate 46.91%
2. 70.21% users add product to Cart, meaning the whistlist is relative high but purchase rate still low than 50%.
3. Improving product limited discount, such as flashsale discount with limited time, could significantly increase purchase conversion.
