Business Question :
Why conversion drops across the sales funnel and which stage contributes the most to revenue loss?

What i found regarding conversion :
1. The largert user drop occurs between Cart to Purchase, with conversion rate 46.91%
2. 70.21% users add product to Cart, meaning the whistlist is relative high but purchase rate still low than 50%.
3. This indicates potential issues in urgency to buy, related to pricing perception or CTA visibility.
4. Improving product limited discount, such as flashsale discount with limited time, could significantly increase purchase conversion and will yield the highest impact on overall revenue.
